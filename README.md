Hue
===============

This tweak gradually changes your iOS device's text color throughout the day: from yellow in the mornings, to light blue at noon, to orange at sundown, to dark blue at night.

It does not replace all colors, it tints whatever color would normally be there, as to not distrupt the UX.

This tweak was made on a whim and is mostly a proof of concept.

Available for download on beta.phillipten.com, and possibly BigBoss in the future.

GPL v3 license. Do whatever you want with the code, but please provide credit if you build upon it.
